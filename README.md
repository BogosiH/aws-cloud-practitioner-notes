Notes and structured preparation for AWS Cloud Practitioner certification

# AWS Cloud Practitioner Notes

## What This Is

This repository documents my structured preparation for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) certification.

The focus is on understanding AWS concepts, services, security, and pricing fundamentals rather than memorizing exam answers.

## What the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Is

The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification validates a high-level understanding of:

* Cloud computing concepts
* Core AWS services and common use cases
* AWS security and compliance principles
* AWS pricing models and cost management

It serves as a foundation for deeper technical AWS certifications.

## 3-Week Study Plan

This preparation follows a disciplined 3-week plan:

* **Week 1:** Cloud foundations and core AWS services
* **Week 2:** Security, networking, databases, and pricing
* **Week 3:** Practice exams, weak-area repair, and exam readiness

Each day includes:

* AWS Skill Builder study
* Light AWS Console exposure
* Written notes to reinforce understanding

## AWS Free Tier Safety Rules

To avoid unexpected AWS charges, the following rules are strictly followed:

* Only Free Tier–eligible services are used
* All resources are deleted immediately after use
* EC2 instances are stopped or terminated the same day
* Billing and cost monitoring are reviewed regularly
* No long-running services are left active

Cost awareness is treated as a core AWS skill.

# Day 2 – Cloud Concepts (AWS Cloud Practitioner)

This section covers the core cloud concepts required for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. The focus is on understanding *why* cloud computing exists and how AWS structures its global infrastructure.

## What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources such as compute, storage, databases, networking, and analytics over the internet.
Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware, customers use cloud services and pay only for what they consume.

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operating Expenditure (OpEx)

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
CapEx refers to upfront investments in physical infrastructure.
**Example:**
A company buys storage servers in advance because it expects future growth, even if that storage is not immediately required.

### Operating Expenditure (OpEx)
OpEx refers to ongoing, day-to-day costs of running a business.
**Example:**
When a company uses AWS storage services, it pays only for the amount of storage used in real time. Costs scale up or down based on demand and are treated as operating expenses.

## Elasticity vs Scalability

### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to increase or decrease capacity to handle long-term growth in demand.

### Elasticity
Elasticity is the ability of a system to automatically scale resources up or down quickly in response to short-term changes in demand.

## High Availability vs Fault Tolerance

### High Availability
High availability ensures a system remains operational with minimal downtime by using redundant components, such as deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones.

### Fault Tolerance
Fault tolerance allows a system to continue operating without interruption even when one or more components fail.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS designs its global infrastructure using **Regions**, **Availability Zones**, and **Edge Locations** to:

* Reduce latency for users worldwide
* Provide high availability and fault tolerance
* Support data residency and compliance requirements
* Enable customers to scale applications globally

## Progress Tracking

Daily progress and key learnings will be updated as the study plan advances.
