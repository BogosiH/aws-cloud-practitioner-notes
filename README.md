# AWS Cloud Practitioner Notes

## What This Is

This repository documents my structured preparation for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) certification.

The focus is on understanding AWS concepts, services, security, and pricing fundamentals rather than memorizing exam answers.

## What the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Is

The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification validates a high-level understanding of:

* Cloud computing concepts
* Core AWS services and common use cases
* AWS security and compliance principles
* AWS pricing models and cost management

It serves as a foundation for deeper technical AWS certifications.

## 3-Week Study Plan

This preparation follows a disciplined 3-week plan:

* **Week 1:** Cloud foundations and core AWS services
* **Week 2:** Security, networking, databases, and pricing
* **Week 3:** Practice exams, weak-area repair, and exam readiness

Each day includes:

* AWS Skill Builder study
* Light AWS Console exposure
* Written notes to reinforce understanding

## AWS Free Tier Safety Rules

To avoid unexpected AWS charges, the following rules are strictly followed:

* Only Free Tier–eligible services are used
* All resources are deleted immediately after use
* EC2 instances are stopped or terminated the same day
* Billing and cost monitoring are reviewed regularly
* No long-running services are left active

Cost awareness is treated as a core AWS skill.

## Progress Tracking

Daily progress and key learnings will be updated as the study plan advances.
